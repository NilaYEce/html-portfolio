    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I have enjoyed designing and being interested in art since I was a child. I am an ambitious, learning-loving, harmonious and orderly person. Because I have based my life on moving forward in the things I love, I am a curious and hardworking person on many issues. I can be a good teammate and coordinator. My biggest dream is to become an art director and to become a well-known person in the industry.</p>
